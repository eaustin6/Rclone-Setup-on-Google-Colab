<h2><b>‚öôÔ∏è How to use?</b></h2>
<!--- Step Area Begin --->
<h4><b>1.First Open the Code on Google Colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheCaduceus/Rclone-Setup-on-Google-Colab/blob/main/Rclone.ipynb" alt="Open Code">Open Code</a></b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Now,Before performing anything Run the Code as shown in the Image to download Setup and configure Rclone!</b></h4>
<p><img src="Img/1.png" alt="1" /></p>
<h4><b>3.To Create/Edit/Delete/View comfig file/remote just run the code as shown in the Image.</b></h4>
<p><img src="Img/2.png" alt="2" /></p>

<p><img src="Img/5.png" alt="5" /></p>
<h4><b>7.If you don't know about Client ID and Client Secret then just hit Enter without entering anything! Otherwise this can be used to bypass login into your Google Account</b></h4>
<p><img src="Img/6.png" alt="6" /></p>
<h4><b>8.After that, It will ask you to grant which level of access to your Rclone config file, to choose it just type and hit enter the list number! I recommend to use number '1' which is for full access.</b></h4>
