<h2><b>‚öôÔ∏è How to use?</b></h2>
<h4><b>1.First Open the Code on Google Colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheCaduceus/Rclone-Setup-on-Google-Colab/blob/main/Rclone.ipynb" alt="Open Code">Open Code</a></b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Now,Before performing anything Run the Code as shown in the Image to download Setup and configure Rclone!</b></h4>

<img src="Img/10.png" alt="10">
<h4><b>12.This is a important step! For Auto-Config write 'n' and hit Enter because here we are using a Remote Machine which is not our Device! So always choose 'n' otherwise login will not work.
